# Keep Pressing — VR Escape Room Experience

**Keep Pressing** is a short VR escape-room narrative built around pressure, routine, and discovery.

You wake up alone inside **Station Ánfora Σ-3**, a containment bunker operated by the MANTIS Initiative. Every 120 seconds, you must enter a numeric code and press a mechanical button to "keep the world safe." As the cycle repeats, small system malfunctions and environmental puzzles reveal that something about the protocol doesn't add up.

Designed for VR, the game uses diegetic interactions—grab, socket, poke, gaze highlighting, climbing—to deliver puzzles that fit naturally within the bunker's tools and machinery. While investigating, you may find a mysterious "Penny" coin that triggers fragments of warm, emotional voice lines, contrasting with the cold instructions of the station's system.

In the final act, the system shifts to a 60-second interval, pushing the player into an impossible rhythm. Failing the cycle once suspends the protocol and unlocks a sealed hatch, leading to a meta-twist that reveals the true nature of the experience.
